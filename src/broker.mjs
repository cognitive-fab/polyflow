// The inversion that makes polyflow work for agents.
//
// In polyrun, the runtime executes effects itself via `handlers`. polyflow has
// no credentials, no connectors and no permission engine — the AGENT has all
// three. So every effect kind becomes a **work order** handed back to the agent:
// the handler parks, the agent claims the order, runs the tool with its own
// gates, and reports the result. Only then does the completion action dispatch.
//
// Durability falls out of polyrun's lease machinery: the pending map is
// in-memory, so a crash loses the promise, the lease expires, the effect is
// re-claimed and the order is re-offered. Nothing is lost, nothing double-runs
// (the completion dispatch is deduped by `${intentId}:done`).

/**
 * The broker contract, so a different one can be swapped in (polycrew's is
 * store-backed, shared across processes). Anything outside this file that
 * reaches into a broker's internals is a bug in this interface, not a
 * convenience:
 *
 *   handler(kind, spec)     a polyrun handler for that effect kind
 *   open(instanceId, opts)  the open work orders for one run
 *   orderById(orderId)      one order, whatever its status, or undefined
 *   issued(instanceId)      every order ever issued for one run
 *   report(orderId, result) resolve or reject the parked handler
 *   abort(reason)           fail every parked handler, for shutdown
 *
 * Three obligations that are easy to miss, because a substitute that ignores
 * them passes every fast test and only fails against a real agent:
 *
 *   1. `handler` MUST keep the worker lease alive for as long as it parks. The
 *      agent is the callback and may take turns, not milliseconds; a handler
 *      that never calls `ctx.extendLease` lets the lease expire, polyrun
 *      re-claims the effect, and the order is re-offered at a higher attempt
 *      WHILE THE FIRST ACTOR IS STILL WORKING IT. That is the duplicate
 *      execution this whole design exists to prevent.
 *
 *   2. `orderById` MUST return at least `{ orderId, instanceId }`. It is the
 *      only way a report gets from an order id back to its run, so it cannot
 *      be the same projection `open()` returns — that one drops `instanceId`
 *      deliberately, because the caller already knows the run.
 *
 *   3. `open` MUST be a pure read under `{ sweep: false }`, and its rows MUST
 *      carry `role`, `claimedBy` and `claimedUntil` beside the obvious fields:
 *      the run view and the crew's page both show them, and a substitute that
 *      omits them renders a busy run as if nobody held anything. `view()`
 *      always asks for the pure read, because `workflow_state` is annotated
 *      read-only and a broker repairing anything there would make it a tool
 *      that writes while advertising that it does not.
 *
 *   4. `report` and `abort` are AWAITED. Settling synchronously is fine and
 *      returning a promise is fine; what is not fine is a substitute whose
 *      caller reads `.ok` off an unawaited promise, which answers `{}` to
 *      every report while the run advances behind it.
 *
 *   5. `report` MUST resolve with an OBJECT. The resolved value becomes the
 *      completion action's data, and an action whose data is a bare string has
 *      no fields for the machine to read. Wrap a non-object as `{ value }`.
 *
 * A broker is owned by exactly one Polyflow: `abort` is unscoped by design, so
 * sharing one across two daemons means either can fail the other's parked
 * handlers. `Polyflow` claims its broker at construction and refuses a second.
